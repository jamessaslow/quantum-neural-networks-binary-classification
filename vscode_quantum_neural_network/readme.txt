Code Structure:
All the code for this project can be found in the 'Quantum Neural Network Code' folder. 
Code compilation is not required as outputs of each notebook are saved. However, if the 
user chooses to re-compile this code, only the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) files are to be 
compiled in ascending numerical order according to the list below:


____Compilation List____
- "1. generate_pqc.ipynb"
- "2.1 fetching_iris_dataset"
- "2.2 fetching_breast_cancer_dataset.ipynb"
- "2.3 fetching_MNIST_dataset.ipynb"
- "3.1 QNN_iris.ipynb"
- "3.2 QNN_breast_cancer.ipynb"
- "3.3 QNN_MNIST.ipynb"

Furthermore, each individual Jupyter Notebook is compiled in the conventional order,
compiled cell by cell, starting from the top of the page to the bottom.


It should also be noted that the "1. generate_pqc.ipynb","2.1 fetching_iris_dataset",
"2.2 fetching_breast_cancer_dataset.ipynb", and "2.3 fetching_MNIST_dataset.ipynb" Jupyter 
Notebooks create the "parameterized_qc.qpy","iris_dataset.csv", "breast_cancer_dataset.csv",
and "MNIST_dataset.csv" files respectively in the "Quantum Neural Network Code" folder. 
Therefore, if these files are already present in the "Quantum Neural Network Code" folder,
the user does not need to compile these Jupyter Notebooks and can begin compiling at 
"3.1 QNN_iris.ipynb" in the compilaton list.
